## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development
I still would like to continue working on this project. I want to set the active state when clicking on the rating buttons, and I would also like to prevent the user from submitting if they haven't selected a rating yet. 


### Useful resources

- [Resource that helped me get the buttons functioning](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30621291/how-do-i-display-button-value-in-a-text-field-in-javascriptnot-jquery) - It was a simple way to get the buttons to display the rating on the thank you state.
